## This is for recording of C++ notes

#### Lesson 1  Basics

1. `#include <stream>`: here the `<>` means the default library. If want to search for the current library, use `#include "stream"`
2. Comment:
    1. `/*` and `*/` signify comment block.
    2. `//` uses for inline Comment
3. Namespace: `using namespace std;`
4. Write to the console: `std::cout<<"This is a example!\n";`
5. Format output, the most common ones are:
   1. \n - newline
   2. \t - tab
   3. std::setw(15) set total width to 15
6. File I/O
    ```
    - Include the <fstream> library
    - Create a stream (input, output, both)
         - ofstream myfile; (for writing to a file)
         - ifstream myfile; (for reading a file)
         - fstream myfile; (for reading and writing a file)
    - Open the file  myfile.open(“filename”);
    - Write or read the file
    - Close the file myfile.close();
    ```
7. User input: a. single input use `std:cin`; b. input a string use `std::getline(std::cin, VariableName)`
8. String operations
    1. Include the Stringstream library.

    `#include<sstream>`
    2. Use getline to get the string from the user

        `std::getline(std::cin, stringVariable);`
    3.  Convert the string variable to a float variable.

     `std::stringstream(stringVariable) >> numericVariable`

#### Lesson 2 Compilation and Execution
###### Compile
1. Open a terminal window
2. change the working directory to the directory of the program
3. Make sure names of folders and files do not have spaces in them
4. To compile the program: g++ filename.cpp -o executableName
5. To execute the program: ./executableName
###### Common mistakes when executing in the terminal:
1. Make sure there are no spaces in filenames
2. Make sure all the files you need are in the working directory (including header files), use 'ls' to check

#### Lesson 3 Arithmetic operations
1. Has to include the math library `#include <cmath>`
2. Arithmetic operators ( +, -, \*, /, % )
3. Compound assignment (+=, -=, \*=, /=, %=, >>=, <<=, &=, ^=, |=)
4. Increment and decrement (++, --)
    1. prefix `++i`: evaluates to the final value of `x`, once it is __already increased__
    2. postfix `i++`: evaluates to the value that `x` had __before being increased__
5. Relational and comparison operators ( ==, !=, >, <, >=, <= )

#### Lesson 4 Control Flow
1. use `size_t`
```
#include <cstddef> //don't forget to include the library
.
.
.
for(size_t i =0; i<5; i++)
```

#### Lesson 5 Pointers
1. Get pointer of a variable: `a` is a variable, and `&a` is the address(pointer) of the variable `a`
2. Dereferencing: use pointer to access the variable:
  1. adding the operator `*` before the pointer variable name

  ```
  // this is an integer variable with value = 54
  int a = 54;

  // this is a pointer that holds the address of the variable 'a'.
  // if 'a' was a float, rather than int, so should be its pointer.
  int * pointerToA = &a;  // notice the space between * and pointerToA

  // If we were to print pointerToA, we'd obtain the address of 'a':
  std::cout << "pointerToA stores " << pointerToA << '\n';

  // If we want to know what is stored in this address, we can dereference pointerToA:
  std::cout << "pointerToA points to " << * pointerToA << '\n';
  ```

#### Lesson 9: Overloading
1. Overloading can be:
  * class (constructors: w/ or w/o initial value)
  * Operators (int operator +)

#### Lesson 10: Templates
1. Syntax1
  ```
  template <typename T>  // this is required, tell the compiler we are using a template
  T functionName (T  parameter1,T  parameter2,...)
  {
      function statements;
  }
  ```
2. Syntax2: if the type is different
  ```
  template <typename T, typename U, typename V>
  T functionName (U  parameter1, V  parameter2,...)
  {
      function statements;
  }
  ```
3. Template for classes
  ```
  template <class T>
  class StudentRecord
  {
  ```
  * The member functions must all be treated as generic functions. You will have to add the template command to each member function.
  ```
  template<class T>
  StudentRecord<T>::StudentRecord(T input)
  {
      grade=input;
  }
  ```

#### Lesson 11 Classes and Inheritance
  1. Syntax
  ```
  //The derived class with Student as base class
  class GradStudent : public Student
  {
      private:
          string degree;
      public:
          GradStudent();
          void setDegree(string degreeIn);
          string getDegree();
  };
  ```
  2. Access Control for Inherited Classes
    * Public Inheritance means all public members of the base class are accessible to the derived class
    * Private Inheritance means all members of the base class are private to the derived class
    * Protected Inheritance means all members of the base class are protected to the derived class.
  3. Example of private Inheritance
    ```
    //The derived class with Student as base class
    class GradStudent : private Student
    {
        private:
            string degree;
        public:
            GradStudent();
            void setDegree(string degreeIn);
            string getDegree();
            void setStudentId(int idIn); //need this to access Student::setId()
            int getStudentId(); //need this to access Student::getId()
    };
    ```
    When we write the member functions, we must explicitly refer to the Student class.
    ```
    int GradStudent::getStudentId()
    {
        //We must access getId() as a private function
        return Student::getId();
    }
    void GradStudent::setStudentId(int idIn)
    {
        //We must access setId() as a private function
        Student::setId(idIn);
    }
    ```

  4. Multiple Inheritance
    * Syntax `class DerivedClass : access BaseClass1, ... ,access BaseClassN`
    e.g.
    ```
    class TA: public Staff, public GradStudent
    {
        private:
            string supervisor;
        public:
            TA();
            void setSupervisor(string input);
            string getSupervisor();
    };
    ```
